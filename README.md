# NeuNet: A Neural Network Library Built from Scratch with NumPy

**NeuNet** is a neural network library built entirely from scratch using **NumPy**. This project is designed as a learning journey to understand how popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch work under the hood.

While primarily for self-education, **NeuNet** can also be a helpful resource for others exploring the foundational concepts of deep learning.

## 🌟 Purpose

The primary purpose of **NeuNet** is to:

1. **Learn and Explore**:
    - Understand and implement the core components of a neural network library, including:
	    - Backpropagation
        - Activation functions
        - Optimizers
        - Loss functions
        - Regularization techniques (like dropout, L1, and L2)
        - etc.
2. **Build for Learning**:
    - Develop a framework that showcases how these components interact at a low level.

If someone else finds value in this project for educational purposes, I’d be proud to share it!
